## HiTS-EQ
This is the document for calculation of more than 4000 association constants from HiTS-EQ Next generation sequencing dataset.

1. Input your data. The data format is in .csv file and the csv file format is shown below.
```{r }
#Data input
test.import <- read.csv('import_data.csv', header=T)
head(test.import)
```
Here f means fraction of reaction and the 100% binding is 1. 0.5 means 50% E-S complex formation or [ES]/[S]) = 0.5.

```{r echo=FALSE}
test <- test.import[-(1:2),]
frac <- 1-as.numeric(test.import[1,2:5])
Enzyme <- as.numeric(test.import[2,2:5])
names(test)<-c("sequence","t0","t1","t2","t3")
rm(filename)
head(test)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
