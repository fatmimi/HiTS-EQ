## HiTS-EQ
This is the document for calculation of more than 4000 association constants from HiTS-EQ Next generation sequencing dataset.

1. Input your data. The data format is in .csv file.
```{r }
#Data input
print("Please input your filename (in .csv format)")
filename <- readline()
filename <- paste(filename,".csv",sep="")
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
