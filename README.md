## HiTS-EQ
This is the document for calculation of more than 4000 association constants from HiTS-EQ Next generation sequencing dataset.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
